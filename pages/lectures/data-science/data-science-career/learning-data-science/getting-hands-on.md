# Getting Hands-on

When you're starting out in data science, the best way to gain experience and build a strong portfolio is to work on real projects. Think of it like learning to cook by actually making meals instead of just reading recipes. Projects help you apply what you learn in a practical way.

## Choosing Your Projects

Before you start learning, it's helpful to decide on the projects you want to work on. This way, you can tailor your learning to the specific skills and knowledge you'll need for those projects.

- **Pick What Interests You**: Choose projects that excite you. Maybe you want to analyze your favorite sports team's performance or create a recommendation system for movies.
- **Plan Ahead**: Decide on your projects early so you can focus your learning on the relevant skills.

## Applying Your Knowledge

When you're learning programming languages and concepts, it's important to understand how they apply to real-world problems. For example:

- **Arrays and Lists**: Use these to store and manage data, like a list of your favorite books or a collection of weather data.
- **Classes**: Create classes to organize your code better, like making a class for a car with attributes like color, speed, and model.

## Finding Projects Online

You can find many existing projects online to get started. Websites like Kaggle offer a wide range of projects you can work on. Here’s how you can use these resources:

- **Kaggle**: This platform provides datasets and project ideas. You can join competitions or simply work on projects that interest you.
- **GitHub**: This is a great place to host your code. Keeping your code on GitHub shows potential employers your work and helps you keep everything organized.

## Hosting and Documenting Your Code

When you write code for your projects, make sure to host it in a clean and organized environment like GitHub. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- **Clean Environment**: Keep your code neat and tidy. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and use it.
- **Documentation**: Use the documentation features to explain what your code does. Good documentation is like a recipe that tells others exactly how to recreate your delicious meal.

::: info CONCLUSION
By working on real data science projects, you're not just learning—you're building a portfolio that shows what you can do. Choose projects that excite you, apply what you learn to solve real problems, and make sure to keep your code organized and well-documented. This hands-on experience will be invaluable as you grow in your data science journey.
