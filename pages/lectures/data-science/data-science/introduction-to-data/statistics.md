# Statistics

Understanding data literacy can be a game-changer, especially when it comes to addressing complex issues like hiring discrimination in the legal system. In this discussion, we'll explore how statistics and data literacy can be leveraged to make a significant impact in proving systemic biases.

## The Challenge of Proving Hiring Discrimination

Hiring discrimination refers to the unfair treatment of candidates based on their traits, such as race, gender, or religion. This bias leads to qualified candidates being overlooked for jobs. Historically, proving such discrimination in court has been challenging. Companies often defended their hiring decisions based on subjective qualities like "fit" and "office culture." However, these terms can sometimes disguise discriminatory practices.

Throughout the 20th century, companies in the US could justify their hiring decisions on a case-by-case basis. While hiring based on subjective qualities was legal, using these qualities as a pretext for discrimination was not. Lawyers typically had to compile numerous individual cases to demonstrate a pattern of discrimination, making it a daunting task to prove systemic bias.

## Elaine W. Shoben's Innovative Approach

Enter Elaine W. Shoben, a pioneering lawyer who changed the game by shifting the burden of proof to companies. Her secret weapon? Statistics. By harnessing the power of data literacy, she demonstrated how statistical analysis could reveal patterns of discrimination that were not immediately apparent.

## The Role of Statistics in Proving Bias

Statistics allow us to distinguish between random occurrences and systematic patterns. For instance, consider traffic patterns: you're likely to see more cars on the road at 8 am on a Wednesday than at the same time on a Sunday. This is not a random event but rather a systematic one, explainable by the concept of rush hour due to standard business hours.

Similarly, Shoben used statistical methods to analyze hiring data, showing that certain groups were disproportionately affected by biased hiring practices. By proving that these patterns were statistically significant, she could argue that the bias was not random but systematic.

## Conclusion

In summary, the application of data literacy and statistical analysis can transform how we address and prove complex issues like hiring discrimination in the legal system. Elaine W. Shoben's innovative use of statistics shifted the burden of proof to companies, making it easier to uncover and address systemic biases. Understanding and utilizing these tools can empower you to make a meaningful impact in various fields, demonstrating the profound value of data literacy.
