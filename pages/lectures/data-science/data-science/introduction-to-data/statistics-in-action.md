# Statistics in Action

How can statistics uncover discrimination in hiring decisions? This question was explored by Elaine Shoben, and while her explanation is heavy on legal jargon, breaking it down can help us understand how statistics play a crucial role in revealing discriminatory practices.

Elaine Shoben's work shows that statistics can be a powerful tool in identifying whether hiring decisions are fair or discriminatory. The key idea is to determine if the results of hiring processes could happen by chance or if they are so unlikely that they must be due to purposeful exclusion.

## Breaking Down the Process

1. **Statistical Improbability**:

   - **Core Idea**: Shoben suggested using statistics to analyze the outcomes of subjective interviews. The goal is to see if the pattern of who got hired is so improbable that it couldn’t have happened by random chance.
   - **Why It Matters**: If the hiring results are highly unlikely to occur by chance, it implies that there’s a systematic issue, potentially indicating discrimination.

2. **Purposeful Exclusion**:

   - **Core Idea**: If the results of the hiring process couldn’t happen by chance, the next logical conclusion is that there must be some purposeful exclusion at play.
   - **Implications**: This means individuals might be excluded from the job due to discriminatory practices rather than a fair evaluation of their qualifications.

3. **Reckless Disregard**:

   - **Core Idea**: When employers are aware that their hiring process has an exclusionary effect and continue to use it, they demonstrate a “reckless disregard” for candidates' rights.
   - **Understanding It**: This concept emphasizes the responsibility of employers to avoid practices that could lead to discrimination, even unintentionally.

## Shifting the Burden to Employers

Once it’s established that the hiring process might be discriminatory, the burden of proof shifts to the employers. They must show that their hiring requirements are valid, necessary, and not discriminatory.

- **Initial Assumption**: We usually assume hiring practices are legitimate.
- **Post-Analysis**: After statistical analysis, if discrimination is suspected, employers must justify their practices.
- **Why This Shift?**: It ensures that job candidates are not unfairly tasked with proving discrimination. Instead, employers must demonstrate the fairness of their practices.

## Conclusion

Using statistics to uncover patterns of discrimination is powerful. Instead of relying on individual experiences, which can be subjective and varied, statistics provide a systematic way to reveal biases in hiring practices. Elaine Shoben’s approach shows that when hiring results are too unlikely to occur by chance, it points to purposeful exclusion, pushing employers to justify their hiring processes.

Understanding and applying these concepts not only helps in identifying unfair practices but also promotes fairness and equality in the workplace.
