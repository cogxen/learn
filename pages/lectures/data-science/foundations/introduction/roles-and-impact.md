# Roles and Impact

Data science is a multifaceted field that integrates computational and inferential thinking to solve real-world problems. Joseph Gonzalez, a professor at UC Berkeley, defines data science as the application of data-centric computational and inferential thinking to understand the world and solve problems. This definition highlights the essence of data science: using data and computational methods to derive insights and make informed decisions.

## Data Scientists vs. Data Engineers

A crucial distinction within the realm of data professionals is between data scientists and data engineers. Data engineers are responsible for ensuring the smooth flow of data from its source to its destination. This means they work on optimizing the pipelines that collect, store, and transport data to where it can be processed and analyzed. They focus on building and maintaining the infrastructure that allows data to move seamlessly within an organization.

On the other hand, data scientists focus on extracting valuable insights from the data. They work closely with data engineers to define metrics, establish data collection methods, and ensure that data science processes integrate well with enterprise data systems. A key aspect of this collaboration is that data scientists must write code that data engineers can reuse, ensuring efficiency and coherence in data handling.

## Data Scientists vs. Statisticians

Data scientists and statisticians also differ in their approaches and responsibilities. Data scientists often handle massive amounts of data, which involves large-scale data collection and data cleaning. They experiment with various methods to create machine learning models, selecting the best one based on performance.

Statisticians, however, typically work with smaller datasets collected through traditional methods like surveys, polls, and experiments. Their focus is on refining a single model to fit the data perfectly. While both professions involve data analysis, data scientists go further by implementing algorithms that enable automatic data processing, leading to automated predictions and actions.

For example, data scientists might automate tasks such as analyzing NASA images to find new celestial bodies, piloting autonomous vehicles, recommending books on Amazon, or simulating new molecules for cancer treatment. Automation can also enhance early epidemic detection, real-time property valuation, targeted advertising, search result relevance, fraud detection, and even weather forecasting.

## Data Scientists vs. Business Analysts

The role of data scientists is also distinct from that of business analysts. Business analysts focus on database design, ROI assessment, financial planning, risk management, and high-level project management. They ensure that business processes align with strategic goals and optimize operations based on data insights.

Data scientists support business analysts by automating report production and speeding up data extraction processes. This collaboration enhances the ability of business analysts to work with much larger datasets and achieve faster results. As noted by data scientist Vincent Granville, such collaborations have enabled business analysts to handle data 100 times larger and ten times faster than before.

## Conclusion

Data science is a powerful tool that continues to revolutionize various fields by providing automated, data-driven solutions. Understanding the distinct roles of data professionals—data scientists, data engineers, statisticians, and business analysts—helps you appreciate the collaborative effort needed to harness the full potential of data. As you dive deeper into data science, remember that the field's ultimate goal is to derive meaningful insights and create impactful solutions that drive progress and innovation.
