# Your Data Science Goal

Let's start with the big question: **What is your final goal, and how do you plan to get there?** Imagine you want to be a data scientist. Now, let's break down the steps you need to take to reach that goal.

## What Do You Need to Learn?

- **Understand the Role**: First, you need to understand what a data scientist does, especially in the field you're interested in. Let's say you want to work in the finance industry. You need to know what data scientists do in finance.
- **Learn About the Industry**: Get to know the financial industry. What kinds of problems do they solve? What data do they use? In finance, you will likely work with numbers in tables. These are called numerical datasets.
- **Focus Your Learning**: Tailor your learning to the tools and software that make working with numerical datasets easier. Here are some tools you might need:
  - **Tableau**: This tool helps you visualize data. Think of it like creating colorful charts and graphs from your data.
  - **Power BI**: Similar to Tableau, it helps you create interactive reports and dashboards.
  - **Python** and **R**: These are programming languages that help you analyze data. Imagine them as special tools in your toolbox that help you solve different problems.
  - **SQL**: This is a language used to manage data stored in databases. It's like organizing your LEGO pieces into neat boxes so you can find them easily.

## Narrow Down the Tools

It's a long list of tools, right? To make it easier, you can look at job postings for data scientists in financial institutions. See what tools they require. This way, you can focus on learning the most important ones.

## Learn How to Apply the Tools

It's not just about knowing the tools; you need to learn how to use them in real-world scenarios. For example, if you know how to use Python, try working on a project that involves analyzing financial data. The key is to understand how to apply your knowledge to solve actual problems.

## Practical Steps to Reach Your Goal

- **Set Your Goal**: Decide what you want to achieve. For instance, you want to become a data scientist in the finance industry.
- **Understand the Requirements**: Look at job postings to see what skills and tools you need.
- **Learn the Necessary Skills**: Focus on learning the tools and software that are most relevant to your goal.
- **Practice Applying Your Skills**: Work on projects that help you apply what you've learned to real-world situations.

By following these steps, you're well on your way to achieving your goal of becoming a data scientist. Remember, it's not just about learning new things; it's about applying what you learn to make a difference. Keep focused, stay curious, and have fun on your data science journey!
