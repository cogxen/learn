# Categorical Variables

When analyzing data about the city's musicians, one key aspect to consider is the categorical variables. These variables provide qualitative information, helping us understand different characteristics and roles within the dataset. Let's focus on one specific categorical variable: job title. This variable tells us the job each musician holds, offering insights into the distribution of roles across the city’s musical landscape.

## Exploring Job Titles

The table below summarizes the job titles of musicians, including the frequency (the count of musicians for each job title), the proportion (frequency divided by the total number of musicians), and the percentage (proportion converted from a decimal to a percentage).

| Job Title | Frequency | Proportion | Percentage |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Performer | 333       | 0.35       | 35%        |
| Manager   | 113       | 0.12       | 12%        |
| Producer  | 87        | 0.09       | 9%         |
| Educator  | 239       | 0.25       | 25%        |
| Composer  | 186       | 0.19       | 19%        |

With a total frequency of **958** musicians, we can see the distribution of job titles across the dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the roles and responsibilities of musicians in the city.

## Understanding the Data

From this table, you can see that out of 958 musicians, 333 are performers. This means that 35% of musicians in the city are performers, calculated as 333 divided by 958, then multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.

Similarly, we can determine that managers make up 12% of the musicians, producers 9%, educators 25%, and composers 19%. These percentages help paint a clear picture of the distribution of job roles among the city's musicians.

## Comparing Categories

By examining the ratios of different categories, you can gain further insights. For example, compare the number of performers to managers. The ratio is 333 performers to 113 managers. When you divide 333 by 113, you get approximately 2.95, indicating there are almost 3 performers for every manager.

### Ratio of Educators to Composers

There are 239 educators and 186 composers. The ratio is 239 divided by 186, which equals approximately 1.28. This tells you that for every composer, there are a little more than one educator, highlighting a relatively balanced distribution between these roles.

### Ratio of Performers to Producers

With 333 performers and 87 producers, the ratio is 333 divided by 87, resulting in approximately 3.83. This indicates there are nearly 4 performers for every producer, showing a significant prevalence of performers compared to producers.

## Conclusion

Categorical variables like job titles are crucial for understanding the composition of a dataset. By analyzing frequencies, proportions, percentages, and ratios, you can uncover patterns and relationships within the data. In the musician dataset, these methods reveal the distribution of job roles, helping you understand the makeup of the city’s musical community. Always remember to interpret these insights in the context of your specific research questions and objectives to make informed, valid conclusions.
