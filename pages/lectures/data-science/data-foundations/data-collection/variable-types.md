# Variable Types

When you're working with data, especially in something like a tree census, you're dealing with two fundamental types of variables: those you measure and those you categorize. Let's break this down to make it clear and enjoyable to understand.

## Measured vs. Categorized

### Numerical Variables

Numerical variables are those that you measure. Think about height, weight, or distance. These variables are always tied to a unit. Without the unit, a number is just a number, and it doesn’t tell you anything useful. For instance, if someone asks you for "three," you'd be confused without context. Three what? Three cups of coffee? Three donuts? Three dollars? Similarly, if a friend asks how far a place is and you say "300," that doesn’t help much. Is it 300 miles, kilometers, or minutes away? The unit is essential.

Numerical variables come in two flavors: discrete and continuous.

- **Discrete Variables**: These come from counting. They are whole numbers. For example, if you count the number of trees in a park, you might get 10, 15, or 20 trees. You won’t get 10.5 trees.
- **Continuous Variables**: These come from measuring. They can take on fractional values. For example, the height of a tree can be 20.5 feet or 30.75 feet. In your tree census, when you measure the height of trees in feet, you're dealing with a continuous numerical variable.

### Categorical Variables

Categorical variables describe characteristics using words or relative values. They tell you something about the data without measuring it.

- **Nominal Variables**: These are names or labels without any inherent order. In your tree census, tree species like London Plane, Honeylocust, or Pin Oak are nominal variables. They provide all the information needed about the species.
- **Dichotomous Variables**: These are variables with only two possible values. For instance, your 'Single' variable, which indicates whether a tree grew alone, has two options: Yes and No. This is a classic example of a dichotomous variable. Think of it as a simple on/off switch with no middle ground.
- **Ordinal Variables**: These have a meaningful order or ranking but the differences between the ranks aren’t uniform or measurable. Imagine you wanted to rate the attractiveness of trees on a scale from 1 to 5. A tree that rates a 5 is considered prettier than a tree that rates a 3, but you can't say it's "twice as pretty." This scale is ordinal. They often appear in surveys where you rate agreement on a scale (like a Likert scale) or in competitions where rankings are given (1st, 2nd, 3rd place).

## Conclusion

Understanding the types of variables you are working with is crucial. Numerical variables, whether discrete or continuous, deal with numbers and require units to be meaningful. Categorical variables describe qualities or categories and include nominal, dichotomous, and ordinal variables. Each type has its unique way of representing data, and recognizing these differences helps you analyze and interpret data accurately.
