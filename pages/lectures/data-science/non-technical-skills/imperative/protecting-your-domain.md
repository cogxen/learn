# Protecting Your Domain

If your job title includes terms like "data science," "predictive analytics," or "advanced analytics," you might have noticed that people's understanding of your role varies significantly. Sometimes, your job title is just a vague label that comes with being part of a team sporting one of those buzzwords in its name. It's even possible that the job description you were given during the interview doesn't quite match the reality of your day-to-day tasks. Sound familiar? If so, you're not alone.

## The Misalignment of Expectations and Reality

Many in the data science field experience a disconnect between their job description and their actual responsibilities. This often stems from organizations struggling to define and distribute analytics tasks effectively. Consequently, you might find yourself handling projects that don't align with your initial expectations or interests. It's a tough spot to be in, but take comfort in knowing that you're part of a larger community facing similar challenges.

Typically, data science teams end up dealing with the backlog of Business Intelligence (BI) and IT tasks. Your boss, especially if they are an analytics middle manager, might be reluctant to turn down any work to demonstrate to their superiors that the team is productive and busy. This scenario places you in a delicate position where you need to balance being a cooperative team member while striving to engage in projects that truly interest and challenge you.

## Proactive Communication is Key

The first step to navigating this complex landscape is to communicate your concerns and aspirations proactively. Here are some strategies to help you assert your career goals:

- **Clarify Your Role**: Reflect on the projects you discussed during your interview and remind your boss about them. Emphasize the types of projects you are passionate about and how they align with your career aspirations.

- **Suggest Beneficial Projects**: Propose projects that you believe would benefit both the team and the organization. This shows initiative and can help steer your work towards areas that interest you.

- **Set Future Goals**: Outline how you envision your role evolving over the next year. This can help your boss understand your long-term goals and possibly align your tasks more closely with your interests.

## Timing and Tact

Be strategic about when to bring up these discussions. Review periods are ideal times to revisit your role and career path. It's essential to balance patience with persistence, showing that you are willing to contribute to various tasks while steering towards your preferred projects.

## Avoiding Pitfalls

While it's important to advocate for the projects you want, be careful not to appear too rigid. Insisting on only working with the latest algorithms and software can limit your boss's flexibility in assigning tasks. Instead, focus on showcasing your analytical skills through diverse projects, especially those that involve predictive modeling. This approach can help you gain recognition as a serious predictive modeler and increase your chances of landing more exciting and challenging projects.

Navigating your career in data science requires a blend of proactive communication, strategic planning, and a willingness to adapt. By clearly articulating your goals, suggesting beneficial projects, and timing your discussions appropriately, you can carve out a path that aligns with your interests and advances your career. Remember, while the journey might be challenging, you have the power to shape your role and make your mark in the field of data science.
