# Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental techniques in machine learning. It's the starting point for anyone who wants to delve into predictive modeling. The concept is straightforward: you have two variables, and you want to predict the value of one based on the value of the other. By the end of this guide, you'll understand how simple linear regression works, how to implement it with sample data, and how to interpret the results.
