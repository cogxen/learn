# Lifecycle

Have you heard of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)? It's a well-defined process that software engineers use to create high-quality software efficiently. Agile is a popular methodology within SDLC that helps teams manage their work more effectively. Similarly, machine learning (ML) has its own lifecycle with distinct stages that developers follow to build robust ML systems. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for anyone looking to dive into the world of machine learning.

In this notebook, we'll break down the machine learning lifecycle into its key stages and explore each one in detail. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how machine learning projects are developed from start to finish.

## Stages of the Machine Learning Lifecycle

1. Problem Formation and Understanding
2. Data Collection and Preparation
3. Model Training and Testing
4. Model Deployment and Maintenance

### Problem Formation and Understanding

The journey begins with identifying and understanding the problem you want to solve. This stage is all about exploring the current business processes to see where machine learning can add value. It's important to remember that not every problem is a good fit for machine learning. During this stage, you'll need to ask critical questions:

- Is machine learning the right solution for this problem?
- What are the ethical considerations?
- What are the desired inputs and outputs?
- What level of prediction error is acceptable?

No machine learning model is perfect. There will always be some errors, false positives, and false negatives. Deciding what level of accuracy is acceptable upfront is crucial.

### Data Collection and Preparation

Data is the lifeblood of any machine learning project. In this stage, you'll source the necessary data. This data could come from internal databases, clients, open-source platforms, or even third-party vendors. The raw data you collect is rarely in a state that a machine can learn from. Therefore, a significant amount of time is spent preparing this data. Key tasks include:

- Labeling data
- Removing irrelevant features
- Discarding outliers
- Transforming data
- Imputing missing values

Once the data is prepped, it's split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. Typically, 80% of the data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. This split ensures that the model can be validated and tested on data it hasn't seen before, which is crucial for assessing its performance.

### Model Training and Testing

With your data ready, it's time to train your machine learning model. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm and feeding it the processed data. The training process consists of multiple passes over the data to build the model. During this stage, you'll:

- Experiment with different algorithms
- Fine-tune parameters
- Evaluate the model's performance

This iterative process continues until you achieve a well-performing model. The goal is to create a model that can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### Model Deployment and Maintenance

Once your model is trained and tested, it's ready for deployment. This means putting the model into production so it can start making real-world predictions. However, the work doesn't stop here. You'll need to set up a regular schedule for retraining the model and monitoring its performance. This ensures that the model continues to perform well over time and adapts to any changes in the data or environment.

<br />
The machine learning lifecycle is a structured and iterative process that guides the development of machine learning models. It starts with understanding the problem, moves through data collection and preparation, proceeds to model training and testing, and concludes with deployment and maintenance. Each stage is critical and requires careful attention to detail.

By following this lifecycle, you can build machine learning models that are not only accurate but also reliable and adaptable to changing conditions. Remember, the key to success in machine learning is not just the algorithms but also the quality of the data and the thoroughness of the preparation and evaluation processes.
