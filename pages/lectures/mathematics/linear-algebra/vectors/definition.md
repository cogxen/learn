# Vectors

A vector is a unique object that possesses both **[magnitude](/lectures/math/linear-algebra/vectors/magnitude)** and direction. Imagine a directed line segment: the length of this line segment represents the magnitude of the vector, and an arrowhead at one end indicates its direction. The arrow points from the tail (starting point) to the head (end point). Isn't that visual so straightforward and elegant?

## Visualizing Vectors

Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment. This line segment's length gives us the magnitude, and the direction is shown by the arrow. Think of it like an arrow pointing in a specific direction, where the length of the arrow tells us how strong or fast something is moving in that direction.

## Identical Vectors

Now, here's an interesting fact: two vectors are considered the same if they have the same magnitude and direction. This means that if we move a vector to a different position without changing its orientation, it remains the same vector. Picture this: if you slide an arrow across a piece of paper without rotating it, itâ€™s still the same arrow!

## Examples of Vectors

Let's bring this concept to life with some examples. Imagine vectors that represent force and velocity. Both force and velocity have specific directions. The magnitude of a force vector tells us how strong the force is, while the magnitude of a velocity vector indicates how fast something is moving.

- **Force Vector**: If you push a door with a certain strength in a specific direction, that push can be represented by a force vector.

- **Velocity Vector**: If you're driving a car at a certain speed in a particular direction, your movement can be described by a velocity vector.

## Notation of Vectors

In writing, we denote vectors using boldface letters such as a or b. When writing by hand, since boldface is not easily achievable, we often use arrows above the letters, like $\vec{a}$ or $\vec{b}$, to represent vectors. This notation helps us distinguish vectors from scalars, which are quantities that have only magnitude and no direction.
