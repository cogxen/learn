# Introduction

SQL is designed to manage and manipulate data in a structured format. Imagine having a magical key that opens up the treasure troves of information stored in vast databases. That's what SQL does! It keeps your data accurate, secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, no matter how large they grow. Think of SQL as your trusty assistant that makes data handling a breeze.

In today's data-driven world, SQL is everywhere! It's the backbone of web frameworks and database applications, making it an essential skill for anyone looking to thrive in the tech industry. Learning SQL not only gives you the freedom to explore and manipulate your data but also empowers you to make smarter, data-driven decisions. Plus, the concepts you learn in SQL are applicable to almost every data storage system out there. Talk about versatility!

## SQLite

In this course, we'll be using the SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). SQLite is a great starting point because it's lightweight, easy to use, and perfect for learning the ropes of SQL. And don't worry, weâ€™ve got you covered with a glossary of all the SQL commands we'll be diving into throughout this course.

## Let's Get Hands-On!

Now, let's jump right into the action with a fun activity! We're going to enter our very first SQL command. Are you ready? Let's do this!

Write the following SQL command:

```sql :line-numbers
SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

Once you've typed that in, hit [[Enter]] and see what happens.

<!--@include: ./_includes/tables/query-results-from-rdb.md-->

You've just executed your first SQL command! How cool is that?
