In today's world, all companies use data, and most of this data is stored in something called databases. Imagine a giant library where all the books are stored neatly on shelves. Databases are like those shelves, but instead of books, they store information.

## What Will You Learn?

- **Create Databases**: Think of this as building your own library shelves to store your books (data).
- **Pull Data from Databases**: This means finding and taking out the books (data) you need from your library.
- **Analyze Data**: After you have your books (data), you will learn to understand and find useful information from them.

## How Will You Practice?

You'll practice these new skills by working on real-world case studies. This means you'll solve problems just like people do in real jobs, such as:

- **Marketing Analysis**: Imagine you run a toy store and want to find out which toys are the most popular. You'll use your data skills to figure this out.
- **User Analysis**: Think about how you use your favorite app. You'll learn how to analyze user data to make the app even better.

## Preparing for Technical Interviews

If you want to get a job as a data analyst, you'll need to pass technical interviews. This Skill Path will help you get ready by:

- **Practicing SQL Queries**: These are like special questions you ask the database to get the information you need.
- **Building Prompt Engineering Skills**: You'll get hands-on experience writing, testing, and refining prompts. Prompts are like the instructions you give to computers to do something specific.

## Why Choose a Career as a Data Analyst?

Being a data analyst is an exciting job where you get to play with data every day. Here are some reasons why you might love it:

- **Solve Puzzles**: If you like solving puzzles, you'll enjoy figuring out how to use data to answer questions.
- **Help Companies**: Your skills will help companies make better decisions, like which products to sell or how to improve their services.
