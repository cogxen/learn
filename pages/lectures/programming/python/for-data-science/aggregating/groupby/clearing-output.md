# GroupBy: Clearing Output

When working with pandas' `groupby` and `agg` functions, you'll often encounter the need to clean up your output to make it more readable and useful. Let's dive into an example and address some common issues that arise.

## Example

Imagine you have a DataFrame `results` and you want to calculate the average home score for each team. You might start with the following code:

```python
mean_goals = results.groupby('home_team').agg({'home_score': 'mean'})
```

This will produce an output like this:

```plaintext
            home_score
home_team
Abkhazia       1.000000
```

## Identifying Issues

There are two potential issues with this output:

1. **Column Naming**: The `home_score` column actually contains the average number of goals, not the raw scores. This can be misleading.
2. **Indexing**: The `home_team` column has become the index. While this isnâ€™t necessarily a problem, it can be inconvenient if you want to interact with `home_team` as a regular column.

## Fixing the Issues

### Renaming Columns

The first problem is definitely an issue. If you revisit this output later, you might forget what the numbers in the `home_score` column represent. To clarify, you should rename the column to something more descriptive, like `mean_home_score`.

### Resetting the Index

The second problem can be fixed by resetting the index so that `home_team` becomes a regular column again.

Here's how you can address both problems:

```python
mean_goals = results.groupby('home_team').agg({'home_score': 'mean'})
mean_goals.columns = ['mean_home_score']
mean_goals = mean_goals.reset_index()
```

Now your output will look like this:

```plaintext
  home_team  mean_home_score
0  Abkhazia          1.000000
```

## Order Matters

It's important to note the order in which you perform these operations. If you reset the index first, `home_team` would become a column, and you would need to adjust your column renaming code accordingly:

```python
mean_goals = results.groupby('home_team').agg({'home_score': 'mean'}).reset_index()
mean_goals.columns = ['home_team', 'mean_home_score']
```

### Using `.rename()`

Alternatively, you can use the `.rename()` method to rename the `home_score` column directly without needing to reassign the columns attribute:

```python
mean_goals = results.groupby('home_team').agg({'home_score': 'mean'}).reset_index()
mean_goals = mean_goals.rename(columns={'home_score': 'mean_home_score'})
```

## Conclusion

Cleaning your output after using `groupby` and `agg` is crucial for maintaining clarity and ease of use in your data analysis. By renaming columns and resetting indexes, you ensure that your DataFrame is both informative and accessible, preventing confusion and making further analysis straightforward. This attention to detail enhances the quality and reliability of your results, allowing you to focus on drawing meaningful insights from your data.
