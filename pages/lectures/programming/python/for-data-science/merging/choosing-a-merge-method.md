# Choosing a Merge Method

When working with datasets, deciding on the appropriate merge method is crucial. There are four main merge methods: inner, left, right, and outer. Choosing the right one can make a significant difference in the accuracy and efficiency of your analysis. Let's dive into how to pick the right merge method based on your needs and the quality of your data.

## Strategies for Choosing a Merge Method

If you haven't thoroughly inspected your dataset, it's generally safer to start with left, right, or outer merges. These methods help you identify areas where data might be missing, providing a more comprehensive view of your dataset. On the other hand, if you are confident in your dataset's quality, the choice of merge method depends on the specific data you need to answer your analytical questions.

## Examples

To better understand how to choose the appropriate merge method, let's look at a couple of examples. Imagine you have two tables: one for games and one for shootouts. The games table includes all the games in the dataset, while the shootouts table only contains information on games that had a penalty shootout.

### Does the Home Team Typically Win Penalty Shootouts??

For this question, you only need data on games that had shootouts. An inner merge is the best choice here. This method will merge rows that have matching entries in both tables, effectively excluding games without shootouts. Since games without shootouts aren't relevant to this question, losing them streamlines your data, making the final table more efficient.

### Has the Percentage of Games Ending in Penalties Increased Over the Years?

This question requires data on all games, both with and without penalties. An inner merge wouldn't work because it would exclude games without shootouts, skewing your results. Instead, a left merge with the games table on the left is ideal. This method keeps all data from the games table and pulls in shootout data where available. This way, you maintain a complete record of all games, allowing you to accurately calculate the percentage of games ending in penalties over time.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right merge method involves understanding the structure and quality of your dataset and aligning it with your analytical needs. Use left, right, or outer merges when you need a comprehensive view and are unsure about data quality. Opt for an inner merge when you need to focus on specific subsets of data. By thoughtfully selecting your merge method, you ensure your analysis is both accurate and efficient, ultimately leading to more reliable insights.
