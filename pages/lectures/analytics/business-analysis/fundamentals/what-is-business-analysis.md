# What is Business Analysis?

Alright, let's start by breaking down what business analysis is. Imagine you're playing with your toys and you want to change how you play with them to make it more fun. Business analysis is kind of like that but for grown-ups working in companies.

According to a big organization called the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA), business analysis is the practice of helping companies change by figuring out what they need and suggesting solutions that make things better for everyone involved.

## Different Ways to Look at Business Analysis

People talk about business analysis, they might mean different things. It's like how some people might call a dog a pet, a friend, or a furry companion. Here are the three main ways people think about business analysis:

### 1. Business Analysis as a Profession

When we talk about business analysis as a profession, we're referring to a career path for individuals who help organizations implement various types of changes. These professionals are known as business analysts, but they might also be called systems analysts, technical analysts, agile analysts, or other job titles depending on their specific roles and the preferences of their organizations.

**Who Are Business Analysts?**

- **Business Analysts**: Typically focused on bridging the gap between IT and business, ensuring technology solutions align with business needs.
- **Systems Analysts**: Often delve deeper into technical requirements and system specifications.
- **Technical Analysts**: Focus on the technical aspects of business solutions.
- **Agile Analysts**: Work within agile frameworks to deliver continuous improvements

Despite the different titles and slight variations in job responsibilities, these roles share a common goal: facilitating organizational change that adds value.

### 2. Business Analysis as a Set of Competencies

Not everyone who performs business analysis tasks identifies as a business analyst. Many roles require strong business analysis skills, even if their primary job isn't within the business analysis profession. These competencies include:

- **Facilitation**: Guiding discussions and workshops to gather requirements and ensure stakeholder alignment.
- **Problem-Solving**: Identifying issues and coming up with effective solutions.
- **Business Knowledge**: Understanding the industry, market trends, and business processes.

These skills are valuable across various roles, from project managers to product owners, and even marketing professionals. Mastering these competencies can significantly enhance one's ability to contribute to organizational success.

### 3. Business Analysis as a Research Discipline

The third perspective views business analysis as a research discipline. This involves analyzing the viability of new business ideas or assessing whether a business should expand into new markets. Key activities in this domain include:

- **Market Analysis**: Studying market trends, customer needs, and competitive landscapes.
- **Feasibility Studies**: Evaluating the practicality and potential success of new initiatives.
- **Data Analysis**: Collecting and interpreting data to support decision-making.

In this context, business analysis techniques are used to gather information, analyze it, and communicate findings effectively. This research-oriented approach helps businesses make informed decisions and minimize risks.

Putting It All Together, next time you find yourself discussing business analysis at work, try to identify whether the conversation is about the profession, competencies, or research activities. Understanding the context will help you appreciate the multifaceted nature of business analysis and its impact on organizational success.
