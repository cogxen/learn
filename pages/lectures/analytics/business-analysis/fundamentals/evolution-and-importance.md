# Evolution and Importance

For as long as businesses have existed, there's been a need to understand customer desires and deliver value. This fundamental concept, though not always labeled as "business analysis," has been essential for successful organizations. To fully grasp the significance of this profession, let's explore its history, beginning in the 1960s.

## The Dawn of Requirements Engineering

In the early 1960s, the role of "requirements engineer" emerged. These engineers were pivotal in constructing buildings, roads, and bridges, developing the necessary requirements for these engineering-focused solutions. This role was inherently technical, laying the groundwork for what would evolve into business analysis.

## Systems Analysts and Mainframe Computing

The 1970s saw a shift as computing power transitioned from academia and government to businesses, spurred by the advent of mainframe computing. This era witnessed a surge in demand for business software, creating a need for business requirements development. Systems analysts emerged as intermediaries between business and technical teams, using systematic methods to model data, data flows, and processing concepts. Their job was to translate business needs into system requirements, ensuring clear communication with developers.

## Personal Computers and User Experience

The 1980s brought significant computing advancements, including better storage and processing power, leading to the proliferation of personal computers. Businesses still relied on mainframes but began pushing for desktop software development. A major innovation was the graphical user interface (GUI), which shifted focus to user experience. Now, requirements elicitation included feature requirements and user experience considerations. This shift led to new analysis techniques and the emergence of the UI/UX analyst role, emphasizing both the front-end look and feel and back-end processing.

## The Internet and Mobile Computing

By the 1990s, the question was no longer about owning a computer but about how many devices you owned. The internet's rise demanded new software for browsing and web applications, while mobile devices and wireless computing brought power off the desktop and into consumers' hands. The need for effective business analysis grew as software became ubiquitous, ensuring products were built right and met user needs.

## Formalization of Business Analysis

The 2000s marked the formalization of business analysis as a profession. The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) developed a body of knowledge and professional certification. Businesses hired increasing numbers of business analysts, leading to the creation of specialty roles. Business process analysts focused on process improvements, while data analysts and business intelligence analysts supported data-driven decisions.

Today, business analysis continues to evolve and deliver value, branching into new contexts and becoming an in-demand profession. As technology advances, the role of business analysts will adapt, ensuring that businesses meet customer needs and remain competitive.
