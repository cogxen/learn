# COVID-19 Deaths Prediction

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Covid-19 is one of the deadliest viruses youâ€™ve ever heard. Mutations in covid-19 make it either more deadly or more infectious. We have seen a lot of deaths from covid-19 while there is a higher wave of cases. We can use historical data on covid-19 cases and deaths to predict the number of deaths in the future.

You are given a dataset of Covid-19 in India from 30 January 2020 to 18 January 2022. The dataset contains information about the daily confirmed cases and deaths. Below are all the columns of the dataset:

- **Date**: Contains the date of the record
- **Date_YMD**: Contains date in Year-Month-Day Format
- **Daily Confirmed**: Contains the daily confirmed cases of Covid-19
- **Daily Deceased**: Contains the daily deaths due to Covid-19

## Objectives

You need to use this historical data of covid-19 cases and deaths to predict the number of deaths for the next 30 days.
