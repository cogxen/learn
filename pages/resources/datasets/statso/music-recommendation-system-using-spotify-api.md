# Music Recommendation System Using Spotify API

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

A Music Recommendation System is an advanced application of Data Science that aims to help users discover new and relevant musical content tailored to their unique preferences and listening behavior. These systems have become integral to the digital music landscape, enhancing user experiences on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music by offering personalized music suggestions. In this article, we will explore the steps to build a Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API and Python. This guide is intended for those interested in understanding the intricacies of recommendation algorithms and leveraging real-time music data from Spotify to create a robust and dynamic recommendation engine.

Below is the process you can follow to sign up for the Spotify developer account and get your credentials.

### 1. Create a Spotify Developer Account

For a Spotify developer account, you need an account at Spotify. If you don’t use Spotify, create an account. You don’t need to purchase any subscription to get your credentials. Once you have created an account at Spotify (or you already have one) log in to your account from your web browser.

### 2. Go to Your Spotify Developer Dashboard

Once you have created an account at Spotify, you need to log in to your Spotify developer dashboard. Here’s the link to the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). As you will be using this developer account for the first time, sign the agreement and verify your email. After these steps, we can move to the next step.

### 3. Create a Spotify Application

Once you have verified an email, you will see an option to create an app in your dashboard. Click on the “Create app” button.

### 4. Fill in the Details

Fill in the app description: **App name**, **App description**, and **Website** and **Redirect URI**.

### 5. Get Your Client ID and Client Secret

After filling in the app description, you will be redirected to your id and password. If you click “View client secret”, you will see your password. Copy your credentials so that you can use them while building a Music Recommendation System using Python.

You can find a detailed guide to get your credentials [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).

## Objectives

Your task is to develop a music recommendation system that leverages the Spotify API to provide personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening history, preferences, and behavior. You will explore various recommendation algorithms, data processing techniques, and API interactions to build an efficient and accurate music recommendation system. The goal is to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by delivering relevant and engaging music suggestions tailored to individual tastes and preferences.
