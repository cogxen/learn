# Market Basket Analysis

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Market Basket Analysis is a data-driven technique used in retail and e-commerce to uncover patterns of co-occurring items in transactions. It aims to identify relationships between products that are frequently purchased together, providing valuable insights for product placement, cross-selling, and marketing strategies.

The dataset provided contains transactional data, with columns representing:

- `BillNo`: A unique identifier for each customerâ€™s bill.
- `Itemname`: The name of the purchased item.
- `Quantity`: The quantity of the item purchased.
- `Price`: The price of each item.
- `CustomerID`: A unique identifier for each customer.

## Objectives

Perform a Market Basket Analysis on the given dataset to discover associations between purchased items. Specifically, the goal is to identify:

- Which items are frequently purchased together by customers.
- The strength of these associations (e.g., support, confidence, lift).
