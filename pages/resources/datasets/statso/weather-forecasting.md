# Weather Forecasting

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Weather forecasting is an application of Time Series Forecasting where we use time-series data and algorithms to make forecasts for a given time.

It is the task of forecasting weather conditions for a given location and time. With the use of weather data and algorithms, it is possible to predict weather conditions for the next n number of days.

For forecasting weather using Python, we need a dataset containing historical weather data based on a particular location. This dataset on Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi.

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `date`: The date of the weather data.
- `meantemp`: The mean temperature of the day.
- `humidity`: The humidity of the day.
- `wind_speed`: The wind speed of the day.
- `meanpressure`: The mean pressure of the day.

## Objectives

To forecast the weather conditions for the next 7 days using the historical weather data of New Delhi.
