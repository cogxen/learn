## Overview

A Book Recommendation System is a data-driven application that suggests books to users based on their preferences and behaviour. It aims to enhance user experience by providing personalized book recommendations, thereby increasing user engagement and satisfaction.

The dataset provided contains information related to books. Here is an overview of the datasetâ€™s structure:

- `bookID`: A unique identifier for each book.
- `title`: The title of the book.
- `authors`: The author(s) of the book.
- `average_rating`: The average rating of the book, indicating user satisfaction with the book.

## Objectives

Your goal is to develop a Book Recommendation System based on ratings and content information.
