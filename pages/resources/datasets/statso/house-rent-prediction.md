# House Rent Prediction

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

The rent of a house depends on a lot of factors. With appropriate data and Machine Learning techniques, many real estate platforms find the housing options according to the customerâ€™s budget. So, if you want to learn how to use Machine Learning to predict the rent of a house, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through the task of House Rent Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

The rent of a housing property depends on a lot of factors like:

- number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen
- size of the property
- the floor of the house
- area type
- area locality
- city
- furnishing status of the house

Here is a dataset of house rent prices in a particular city. Below are the features in the dataset:

- **BHK**: Number of Bedrooms, Hall, Kitchen.
- **Rent**: Rent of the Houses/Apartments/Flats.
- **Size**: Size of the Houses/Apartments/Flats in Square Feet.
- **Floor**: Houses/Apartments/Flats situated in which Floor and Total -
- **Number of Floors** (Example: Ground out of 2, 3 out of 5, etc.)
- **Area Type**: Size of the Houses/Apartments/Flats calculated on either Super Area or Carpet Area or Build Area.
- **Area Locality**: Locality of the Houses/Apartments/Flats.
- **City**: City where the Houses/Apartments/Flats are Located.
- **Furnishing Status**: Furnishing Status of the Houses/Apartments/Flats, either it is Furnished or Semi-Furnished or Unfurnished.
- **Tenant Preferred**: Type of Tenant Preferred by the Owner or Agent.
- **Bathroom**: Number of Bathrooms.
- **Point of Contact**: Whom should you contact for more information regarding the Houses/Apartments/Flats.

## Objectives

Your task is to predict the rent of a house based on the given features using Machine Learning algorithms.
