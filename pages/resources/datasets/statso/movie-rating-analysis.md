# Movie Rating Analysis

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

We all watch movies for entertainment, some of us never rate it, while some viewers always rate every movie they watch. This type of viewer helps in rating movies for people who go through the movie reviews before watching any movie to make sure they are about to watch a good movie

Analyzing the rating given by viewers of a movie helps many people decide whether or not to watch that movie. So, for the Movie Rating Analysis task, you first need to have a dataset that contains data about the ratings given by each viewer. For this task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle that contains two files: one file contains the data about the movie Id, title and the genre of the movie and the other file contains the user id, movie id, ratings given by the user and the timestamp of the ratings.

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `ID`: Unique identifier for each movie
- `Title`: Title of the movie
- `Genre`: Genre of the movie

## Objectives

Your task is to analyze the dataset and provide insights into the ratings given by viewers for each movie. You are required to calculate the average rating for each movie and provide insights into the ratings given by viewers for each movie. You can also analyze the ratings given by viewers for each genre of the movie and provide insights into the ratings given by viewers for each genre of the movie.
