# Unemployment Analysis

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19.

The dataset includes features such as the region, date, frequency, estimated unemployment rate, estimated employed, estimated labour participation rate, region.1, latitude, and longitude.

## Objectives

Your task is to analyze the unemployment rate in India during Covid-19 and identify the regions with the highest and lowest unemployment rates. You can also analyze the relationship between the unemployment rate and the labour participation rate to gain insights into the labour market in India.
