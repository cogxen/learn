# Metro Operations Optimization

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

The dataset includes multiple files that detail various aspects of the metro system, structured as follows:

- **Agency**: Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.
- **Calendar**: Service schedules delineating the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates for these schedules.
- **Routes**: Details of metro routes including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.
- **Shapes**: Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths taken by the metro lines.
- **Stop Times**: Timetables for each trip indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.
- **Stops**: Locations of metro stops including latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Trips**: Information linking trips to routes, including details like trip identifiers and associated route IDs.
- These datasets collectively offer a comprehensive view of the operational and structural components of the Delhi Metro, suitable for conducting extensive analysis and optimization.

## Objectives

Despite the extensive network and frequent services offered by Delhi Metro, overcrowding during peak hours and uneven service distribution remain critical challenges affecting commuter satisfaction and operational efficiency. The primary goal is to optimize metro operations by adjusting the supply (e.g., train frequency, capacity) to better match the demand across different times of the day and various routes.

By leveraging the available datasets, identify key areas where adjustments in train frequencies could significantly improve the service levels, reduce wait times, and alleviate overcrowding.
