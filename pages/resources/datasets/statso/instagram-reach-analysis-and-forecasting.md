# Instagram Reach Analysis & Forecasting

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Analyzing and forecasting the reach of a professional social media account can help the content creator plan and optimize their social media strategy. By knowing the expected reach of their Instagram account, they can plan the timing and content of their posts to maximize engagement and grow their followers.

Hereâ€™s a dataset of the Instagram reach of the account of Aman Kharwal we collected from the professional dashboard of Meta. Below are the features in the data:

- **Date**
- **Instagram Reach**

## Objectives

You are required to identify the patterns and trends in the data, identify any seasonality or cyclic behaviour, and detect any outliers or anomalies. Based on the insights gained from the analysis, develop a predictive model that can forecast the reach of the Instagram account for the next period of time.
