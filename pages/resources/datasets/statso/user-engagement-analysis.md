# User Engagement Analysis

<DownloadBadge githubURL=""></DownloadBadge>

## Overview

Bounce rate is a crucial metric in web analytics that measures the percentage of visitors who land on a website and leave without engaging in any further interactions. It indicates the effectiveness of a website in capturing and retaining the attention of its visitors.

Given a dataset containing information about the bounce rate, session duration, and other features of website users, the goal is to analyze the bounce rate and its relationship with session duration.

## Objectives

Your task is to gain insights into user engagement and identify factors that contribute to a high or low bounce rate. Find answers to questions such as:

- What is the overall bounce rate of the website?
- Are there any specific patterns or trends in the relationship between bounce rate and session duration?
- Can we identify segments of users with different bounce rate behaviours?
