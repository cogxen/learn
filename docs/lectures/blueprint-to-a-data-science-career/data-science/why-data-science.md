# Why Data Science?

Let's explore why a career in data science is a great choice. I'll give you three main reasons, but first, let me show you why you're already a data scientist!

## You're Already a Data Scientist!

Think about the last time you wanted to buy a toy or a game. Did you:

- Read the descriptions multiple times? You wanted to be sure it was the right one.
- Compare it with other similar toys or games? You wanted to find the best option.
- Check if you had enough money to buy it? You needed to know if you could afford it.

If you did any of these, you were doing what data scientists do. You were gathering information (data) and analyzing it to make a decision. In data science, we do the same thing but on a bigger scale and with more tools.

## Three Reasons to Choose Data Science

### Forever Relevant

Data science is always important because every industry produces data. This data helps improve businesses, schools, hospitals, and more. No matter where you go, data science skills are needed.

Industries Using Data Science:

- **Healthcare**: Analyzing patient data to improve treatments.
- **Education**: Understanding how students learn best.
- **Retail**: Figuring out what products customers like the most.

Since data is everywhere, you can work in any industry you like. Even if you decide to switch industries later, your data science skills will still be valuable.

### Plenty of Opportunities

### High Demand, High Pay

Data scientists earn good salaries because their work is very important to businesses. Just like oil was very valuable in the past, now data is considered the "new oil." It helps companies make more money and improve their services.

Why Data Scientists Earn Well:

- **Importance**: Companies need data scientists to understand their data and make smart decisions.
