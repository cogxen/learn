# Data Types

All data in a relational database is of a certain data type. This ensures that the data is stored and processed efficiently. Some common data types include:

- **INTEGER**: Represents positive or negative whole numbers.
- **TEXT**: Represents text strings.
- **DATE**: Represents dates formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
- **REAL**: Represents decimal values.
- **BLOB**: Represents binary large objects like images or audio files.

## Example

For reference, hereâ€™s a snapshot of the `celebs` table:

In our celebs table:

- **id**: `INTEGER`
- **name**: `TEXT`
- **age**: `INTEGER`

These data types help the database understand how to handle and store the information effectively.
