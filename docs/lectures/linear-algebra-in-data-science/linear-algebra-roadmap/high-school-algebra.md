# High School Algebra

## Real Numbers and Vector Spaces

First, let's start by refreshing your memory on real numbers and vector spaces. This might sound complicated, but it's really about understanding the basic building blocks of math.

### Real Numbers

Real numbers are like all the numbers you can think of. They include:

- **Whole Numbers**: $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, etc.
- **Fractions**: $1\over2$, $3\over4$, etc.
- **Decimals**: $0.1$, $2.5$, etc.
- **Negative Numbers**: $-1$, $-2$, etc.

Real numbers are everywhere, and you use them every day. Remember when you count your toys or share a pizza with friends? You're using real numbers!

### Vector Spaces

Vector spaces might sound tricky, but let's break it down. Imagine you have a bunch of arrows pointing in different directions. These arrows are called vectors. They have two important features:

- **Direction**: Which way the arrow points.
- **Magnitude**: How long the arrow is.

Vector spaces are like a playground where you can add these arrows together and see what happens. It's fun and helps you understand more complex math later on.

## Angles and Trigonometry

Angles and trigonometry are all about understanding shapes and how they move.

### Angles

Angles are like slices of a pizza. They show how much you need to turn to go from one direction to another. You measure angles in degrees. For example:

- **A full circle**: $360^\circ$.
- **A right angle**: $90^\circ$ (like the corner of a square).

### Trigonometry

Trigonometry sounds fancy, but it's just about the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. If you know one angle and one side of a triangle, you can figure out everything else about it. Cool, right?

## Norm vs. Euclidean Distance

Understanding the difference between norm and Euclidean distance is super important.

### Norm

Norm is like measuring how long a vector (your arrow) is. It's the length of the arrow, no matter which way it's pointing.

### Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance measures how far apart two points are. Imagine you and a friend are standing on a big piece of paper. You both draw arrows to different spots. The Euclidean distance is how far you'd have to walk to get from your friend's arrow to yours.

## Pythagorean Theorem and Orthogonality

These might sound like big words, but they're very helpful concepts.

### Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem helps you figure out the length of the sides of a right triangle. It's like a magical formula: $a^2+b^2=c^2$

### Orthogonality

Orthogonality is when two vectors (arrows) are at a right angle (90 degrees) to each other. It's like how the corner of a piece of paper is perfectly square.

## Cartesian Coordinate System

The Cartesian Coordinate System helps you visualize vectors and understand their geometric properties.

### Visualizing Vectors

Imagine a big graph with an $x-axis$ (horizontal) and a $y-axis$ (vertical). Each point on the graph represents a pair of numbers (coordinates). Vectors are like arrows pointing to these points. This system helps you see and understand the position and direction of vectors.

::: info CONCLUSION
By refreshing your memory on these topics, you're building a strong foundation for understanding more complex math and applying it to real-world problems. Remember, math is like a puzzle, and each piece you learn helps you see the bigger picture.
